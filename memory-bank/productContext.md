# Product Context

## Why Nura Exists

Nura addresses a critical but under-recognized problem in software engineering: **psychological barriers in technical onboarding** disguised as documentation issues. The real challenge isn't missing documentation - it's the **fear-based culture** that prevents developers from asking questions.

### Root Cause Analysis

**Industry Problem**: Tech meritocracy creates "impostor syndrome amplification"
- Developers avoid questions to prevent appearing incompetent
- "Failure is not allowed" culture in competitive tech environment
- Social pressure to appear competent = learning paralysis

**Business Impact**: $150K+ per developer/year in sub-optimal productivity during 2+ week ramp-up periods

## Problems Nura Solves

### 🎯 Primary Problem: Fear-Based Learning Paralysis
**Current State**: New developers spend 2+ weeks being unproductive, afraid to ask questions
**Nura Solution**: Private AI mentorship eliminates social exposure, creates judgment-free learning

### 📚 Secondary Problem: Fragmented Knowledge Access
**Current State**: Information scattered across Bitbucket, Confluence, tribal knowledge
**Nura Solution**: Unified knowledge base with semantic search + business context integration

### 🏗️ Tertiary Problem: Business Context Disconnect
**Current State**: Developers implement code without understanding business rationale
**Nura Solution**: Every technical response includes relevant business context when applicable

## How Nura Should Work

### 🤖 Core Interaction Model

**User Experience Flow**:
1. Developer asks question in natural language
2. Nura Core analyzes intent, routes to specialist agent
3. Agent provides answer with confidence score (1-10)
4. Response includes technical info + business context
5. Format: "Te recuerdo que..." (teaching without condescension)

### 🎭 Agent Specialization

**Dev Agent** 💻:
- Analyzes code patterns and implementation
- Provides examples from existing codebase
- Explains architectural decisions with business rationale

**PM Agent** 📋:
- Connects features to business objectives
- Explains "why" behind technical decisions
- Provides product context for implementation choices

**Architect Agent** 🏗️:
- Maps service dependencies and relationships
- Generates structural views from code analysis
- Explains impact of architectural changes

### 🔍 Knowledge Integration Strategy

**Unified Context Approach**:
- Same BGE-M3 embedding model for all content types
- Business rules linked to code implementations
- Documentation synchronized with code reality
- Cross-agent context sharing for comprehensive answers

## User Experience Goals

### 🛡️ Psychological Safety
- **Private Learning**: No social exposure during question process
- **Judgment-Free Environment**: AI never criticizes or condescends
- **Confidence Building**: Progressive disclosure reduces overwhelm
- **Mistake Tolerance**: Safe space to ask "obvious" questions

### ⚡ Efficiency
- **Maximum 3 Options**: Prevents analysis paralysis
- **Contextual Responses**: Relevant to current work without over-explanation
- **Business Integration**: Technical answers include business "why"
- **Continuous Learning**: AI remembers weaknesses, reinforces learning

### 🎯 Professional Growth
- **Mentorship Pattern**: AI as senior developer mentor
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Not just answers, but understanding
- **Pattern Recognition**: Teaches architectural patterns through examples
- **Career Development**: Builds confidence for progression
