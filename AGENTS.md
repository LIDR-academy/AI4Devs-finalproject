# AGENTS.md — Project instructions & memory

This file is the persistent memory and working agreement for AI assistants on this
project. Read it at the start of every session.

## Working conventions

- **Personal project.** Owner: Xavier Vergés (<xaviverges@gmail.com>).
- **Memory lives here.** Record durable project facts, decisions, and context in this
  file (AGENTS.md) — not in the default `.claude` memory directory.
- **Prompt log.** Log **only project-content prompts** (those producing deliverables:
  architecture, data model, API, code, etc.). **Skip meta/setup/workflow prompts.** For
  each logged prompt, do **both**:
  1. Append it to the chronological **"Log de prompts"** section at the end of
     `prompts.md`, with a short summary ("resumen") of the assistant's response.
  2. File the most relevant ones into their matching structured deliverable section,
     respecting the "max 3 per section" rule.
- **Don't invent.** When anything is ambiguous or unknown, ask the user rather than
  guessing.

## Project facts

- **Context:** AI4Devs final project (Lidr). The `main` branch currently contains only
  documentation scaffolding: `readme.md` (project deliverable template, in Spanish) and
  `prompts.md` (prompt log template). Application code is expected on other branches.
- **Product:** Clickoteca — LEGO set rental-by-subscription library. MVP defined as
  an OpenSpec change at `openspec/changes/clickoteca-mvp/` (not yet implemented —
  `tasks.md` all unchecked). Pricing (BASIC 14,99€/mes, PREMIUM 24,99€/mes) is
  benchmarked against real competitors (Brick Borrow, Pley, BrickDrop, NetBricks) —
  see `design.md` D9. Seed catalog data/images recommended source: Rebrickable
  (free public dataset/API, has `img_url` per set; no age/difficulty fields —
  curate those manually for the seed subset).
- _(More facts to be added as the project develops.)_
