# Cross-Functional Requirements

## Overview
Cross-functional requirements are requirements that span across different functional areas of the software, ensuring the system is robust, secure, scalable, and provides a consistent user experience.

## Performance Requirements
- **API Response Time**: < 500ms for 95% of requests
- **Frontend Load Time**: < 2 seconds for page loads
- **Database Query Performance**: Optimized queries with caching (hit rate > 80%)
- **Concurrent Operations**: Handle multiple users creating transactions simultaneously

## Security Requirements
- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive financial data encrypted
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with secure session management
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- **Password Security**: Strength validation, hashing, and secure reset functionality
- **Session Security**: Protection against session hijacking and secure termination

## Scalability Requirements
- **Multi-User Support**: Handle multiple users with isolated data
- **Database Scaling**: Scalable data management
- **Caching Strategy**: Caching implementation for expensive operations
- **Vertical Slicing Architecture**: Modular design for easy feature expansion

## Maintainability Requirements
- **Code Coverage**: > 80% for backend, > 70% for frontend
- **DDD Principles**: Strict adherence to domain boundaries
- **Testing Strategy**: TDD + BDD with comprehensive integration tests
- **Documentation**: API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI) for all endpoints
- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns and business domains

## Quality Requirements
- **Zero Critical Bugs**: No critical bugs in production
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and validation
- **Database Transactions**: Atomic operations for data integrity
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation at boundaries using DTOs

## Accessibility Requirements
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: Full accessibility standards
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and logical navigation
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All functionality accessible via keyboard
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Touch-friendly interface across all devices

## Cross-Platform Requirements
- **Browser Compatibility**: Consistent functionality across different browsers
- **Device Support**: Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Offline Support**: Maintain functionality without internet connection
- **Multi-Device Sync**: Real-time data synchronization across devices

## Internationalization Requirements
- **Multi-Language Support**: English and Spanish language support
- **Currency Support**: Multiple currency handling (USD, EUR, GBP, etc.)
- **Localized Formats**: Date, number, and currency formatting per locale

## Implementation Notes
- These requirements apply to all development phases and user stories
- Must be considered during vertical slicing implementation
- Testing should validate compliance with these requirements
- Performance and security requirements are non-negotiable
- Accessibility requirements ensure inclusive user experience
