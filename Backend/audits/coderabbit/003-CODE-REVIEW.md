## Positive Findings

### ✅ Code Duplication Successfully Eliminated

The code duplication issue identified in review #002 has been successfully resolved:

**Implementation:**
- Created shared `UserMapper` utility class at `Backend/src/common/mappers/user.mapper.ts`
- Removed duplicate `mapToUserResponse()` method from `AuthController`
- Removed duplicate `mapToResponseDto()` method from `UsersController`
- Both controllers now use `UserMapper.toResponseDto(user)` consistently

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Follows DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- ✅ Single source of truth for User-to-DTO mapping
- ✅ Easier maintenance - changes only need to be made in one place
- ✅ Consistent mapping logic across all controllers

### ✅ Linter Issues Resolved

**jwt.strategy.ts:**
- ✅ Removed unnecessary `async` keyword from `validate()` method
- ✅ Changed return type from `Promise<AuthenticatedUser>` to `AuthenticatedUser`
- ✅ Method now correctly reflects that it performs synchronous operations only

**main.ts:**
- ✅ Added proper error handling with async IIFE
- ✅ Wrapped `bootstrap()` call in try-catch block
- ✅ Added error logging and process exit on failure
- ✅ Used `void` operator to explicitly mark IIFE promise as intentionally unhandled

### ✅ Architecture Compliance

All changes maintain compliance with the CSED pattern:
- ✅ Controllers use shared mapper utility (appropriate layer separation)
- ✅ Services continue to return entities (not DTOs)
- ✅ Controllers handle entity-to-DTO mapping (correct responsibility)

### ✅ Code Quality Improvements

**UserMapper Implementation:**
- ✅ Well-documented with JSDoc comments
- ✅ Clear method naming (`toResponseDto`)
- ✅ Static method for utility usage (no instantiation needed)
- ✅ Proper TypeScript types
- ✅ Located in appropriate directory (`common/mappers/`)

**Controller Updates:**
- ✅ Clean imports (removed unused `User` and `UserResponseDto` imports where applicable)
- ✅ Consistent usage pattern across all endpoints
- ✅ Maintained existing functionality

## Files Reviewed

### New Files
1. `Backend/src/common/mappers/user.mapper.ts` - Shared mapper utility (24 lines)

### Modified Files
1. `Backend/src/modules/auth/controllers/auth.controller.ts` - Updated to use UserMapper
2. `Backend/src/modules/users/controllers/users.controller.ts` - Updated to use UserMapper
3. `Backend/src/common/strategies/jwt.strategy.ts` - Fixed async/await linter issue
4. `Backend/src/main.ts` - Added error handling for bootstrap

## Recommendations

### ✅ All Previous Issues Resolved

All issues identified in review #002 have been successfully addressed:
- ✅ Code duplication eliminated with shared UserMapper
- ✅ Linter errors fixed
- ✅ Error handling improved

### Future Considerations

1. **Consider Adding Tests:** If not already present, consider adding unit tests for:
   - `UserMapper.toResponseDto()` with various User entity states
   - Edge cases (null/undefined handling if applicable)

2. **Consider Additional Mappers:** If other entity-to-DTO mappings are needed in the future, follow the same pattern:
   - Create mapper classes in `Backend/src/common/mappers/`
   - Use static methods for utility functions
   - Maintain consistent naming conventions

3. **Documentation:** The UserMapper is well-documented. Consider adding usage examples in project documentation if this pattern will be used for other entities.
