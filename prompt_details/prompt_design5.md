## **Using Claude**

## Prompt:
 
Create separate views for the Digital Twin Simulation, check the image atached to follow the same design. Add a detailed mockup panel for a Digital Twin Simulation Interface:  Interactive sliders for lifestyle adjustments and visualizations of simulated health outcomes. - Narrate: “Curious about lifestyle changes? Use our Digital Twin to simulate different choices and see potential health impacts.” - Action: Show user adjusting sliders for diet and exercise, with real-time visual feedback on projected health outcomes.

**RESPONSE**

I'll create a React component for a Digital Twin Simulation interface that matches the design style shown in the image while adding interactive elements for lifestyle adjustments.
