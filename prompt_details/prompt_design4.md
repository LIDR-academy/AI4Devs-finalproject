I'll create a React component for the Health Coach chat interface that matches the design style shown in the image while adding an interactive chat experience.

I've created a comprehensive Health Coach chat interface that includes:

A welcoming header with clear instructions
Suggested prompts for common health questions
A chat message area showing:

User messages (purple, right-aligned)
AI responses (gray, left-aligned)
Avatars for both user and AI


An input area with:

Text input field
Send button
Enter key support



The interface features:

Clean, modern design matching the original image's style
Responsive layout
Interactive elements with hover states
Sample diabetes risk assessment response

Adding additional features like message timestamps or typing indicators?
