## 1. General Product Description

This section provides an in-depth overview of VitaMind, from its objectives and main features to user experience design and installation instructions.

### **1.1. Objective:**

   - **Purpose**: VitaMind aims to empower individuals to take charge of their health by providing a comprehensive platform for health records management, personalized health coaching, and chronic disease prevention. With VitaMind, users can keep track of personal health information, gain insights into their risk for common chronic diseases, and explore lifestyle adjustments that could enhance their wellbeing.
   
   - **Value Proposition**: VitaMind’s core value is in its AI-driven approach to personal health management. Unlike traditional apps that require manual input or provide limited insights, VitaMind utilizes AI to:
     - Interpret complex medical records and test results.
     - Offer personalized health recommendations.
     - Simulate lifestyle changes, allowing users to understand how diet, exercise, and other factors could impact their health.
   
   - **Target Audience**: VitaMind is specifically tailored for:
     - Individuals with chronic conditions who want proactive management tools.
     - Health-conscious users who seek data-driven insights into their wellbeing.
     - Those interested in understanding their health risks and exploring lifestyle modifications.

### **1.2. Main Features and Functionalities:**

   - VitaMind includes three core components: **Health Records Manager**, **Personal Health Coach**, and **Digital Twin**. Each feature addresses a specific need within the health management experience, offering users a centralized and cohesive platform.

   - **Health Records Manager**:
     - **User Data Input**: Users can enter personal health information, such as age, weight, and fitness level. They can upload medical records or lab results in PDF or image format, or fill out a structured form.
     - **Document Handling**: Medical records are stored securely with end-to-end encryption, ensuring user privacy and data protection.
     - **Data Parsing**: The AI engine parses and summarizes uploaded documents, explains medical terminology, and offers insights into test results. This feature provides users with accessible, understandable interpretations of complex medical data.
     - **Risk Assessment**: Based on the user's data, VitaMind provides personalized risk assessments for conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension, using risk scoring models and machine learning algorithms trained on relevant medical datasets.
     - **Focus**: Emphasis is placed on accurate handling and analysis of PDFs, images, and structured data input formats to ensure comprehensive coverage of user-uploaded information.

   - **Personal Health Coach**:
     - **Feedback Schedule**: VitaMind provides daily health plans, notifications, and alerts specifically designed for users managing chronic diseases.
     - **Health Focus**: Personalized health goals are established based on individual data and wellness priorities, with regular check-ins and motivational reminders.
     - **Interactivity**: A chatbot allows users to ask freeform health questions, receiving simple, friendly explanations on complex topics. The AI responds to questions such as “What is my risk for diabetes?” using the latest data and health records to ensure accurate, context-driven responses.

   - **Digital Twin**:
     - **Simulation Depth**: The Digital Twin allows users to simulate potential lifestyle adjustments (e.g., diet changes, exercise routines) and assess their impact on health factors related to chronic diseases.
     - **Focus**: The current focus is on managing heart disease, diabetes, blood glucose issues, and blood pressure, providing users with insights on how lifestyle modifications could influence their risk levels and health outcomes.
     - **Update Frequency**: The model is designed to be updated frequently as users provide new health data or make changes, ensuring the simulations remain relevant and accurate.

### **1.3. Design and User Experience:**

   - **Overview of User Flow**:
     - **Landing Page**: The user is welcomed with a dashboard showcasing the application’s primary sections—Health Records, Health Coach, and Digital Twin. Each section is prominently featured, allowing users to easily navigate to the tools they need.
     - **Health Records Upload**: Users can securely upload their medical records by selecting PDF or image files, or by filling out forms. A step-by-step guide helps them understand how to input their data, and the AI immediately begins processing and summarizing the information.
     - **Interactivity with Health Coach**: Users can interact with the AI-powered health coach to get personalized recommendations and simplified explanations for complex health terms. The chatbot interface allows freeform questions, creating an interactive and supportive user experience.
     - **Digital Twin Simulations**: By selecting lifestyle factors (e.g., exercise frequency, dietary changes), users can view simulated impacts on their health. This feature offers engaging visual feedback, making it easy to understand potential health outcomes.

   - **Visual Content Recommendations**:
     - **Images**: Include screenshots of the dashboard, document upload interface, and chatbot interactions to give users a clear view of each feature.
     - **Video Walkthrough**:
       - **Example**: A short video shows a user uploading a medical report, viewing the AI-generated summary, asking a health question in the chatbot, and seeing a digital twin simulation for a dietary change. This demonstrates ease of use and helps users understand how each feature functions.
     - **User Feedback**: Include callouts in the video or annotations in the images to highlight user-friendly elements (e.g., “Easy upload process,” “Clear summary of medical terms”).

### **1.4. Installation Instructions:**

   - Follow these instructions to set up VitaMind on a local development environment.

   - **Prerequisites**:
     - Install the necessary libraries and tools:
       - **Python 3.8+** for backend services.
       - **Node.js** for frontend development.
       - **Docker** (optional) for containerized deployment.
   
   - **Frontend and Backend Setup**:
     - **Frontend**: Navigate to the frontend directory and run:
       ```bash
       npm install
       npm start
       ```
     - **Backend**: Navigate to the backend directory and run:
       ```bash
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       python manage.py migrate
       python manage.py runserver
       ```
   
   - **Database Configuration**:
     - Set up a local database (e.g., PostgreSQL or SQLite) and configure environment variables.
     - Apply migrations:
       ```bash
       python manage.py migrate
       ```
     - Seed initial data if required:
       ```bash
       python manage.py loaddata initial_data.json
       ```
   
   - **Environment Variables**:
     - Create an `.env` file in the root directory with required variables (database credentials, API keys).
     - **Example**:
       ```plaintext
       DB_NAME=vita_db
       DB_USER=username
       DB_PASSWORD=password
       SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
       ```
   
   - **Running the Application**:
     - For a quick start, you can run the backend and frontend simultaneously if Docker is configured:
       ```bash
       docker-compose up
       ```
     - Alternatively, start each service separately as described above.

   - **Optional Troubleshooting**:
     - If issues arise, refer to the common troubleshooting guide in the repository (link pending) or consult the installation FAQ.
