I'll help analyze the health records manager component of the VitaMind project based on the provided documentation.

## Project Summary
The Health Records Manager is one of three core components of VitaMind, designed to help users securely manage and gain insights from their medical records. It focuses on:

- Secure upload and storage of health records
- AI-powered parsing and interpretation of medical data
- Risk assessment based on user health data
- Privacy-first approach with end-to-end encryption

## Key Features Identified

### 1. User Data Input
- Personal health information entry (age, weight, fitness level)
- Medical record upload support (PDF/image formats)
- Structured form input options

### 2. Document Handling
- End-to-end encryption for data security
- Secure storage of medical records
- File size limit of 10 pages per upload

### 3. Data Processing
- AI-powered parsing of uploaded documents
- Medical terminology explanation
- Test result interpretation
- Summarization of key health insights

### 4. Risk Assessment
- Personalized health risk scoring
- Focus on conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension
- ML-based analysis using medical datasets

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
```typescript
// Key components needed:
- File upload interface
- Document preview/summary view
- Risk assessment dashboard
- Form inputs for personal health data
```

### Backend
```python
// Required endpoints:
- File upload/processing
- Data encryption/storage
- Risk assessment calculation
- Health record management
```

### Security
```plaintext
- End-to-end encryption
- PII masking
- HIPAA/GDPR compliance
- Secure data storage
```

## Questions for Clarification

1. **Data Processing**
   - What specific medical terminology/conditions should the AI focus on interpreting?
   - Are there preferred medical datasets for training the risk assessment models?

2. **Security Requirements**
   - Are there specific encryption standards required beyond AES-256?
   - What level of HIPAA compliance is needed for the initial MVP?

3. **Technical Implementation**
   - Should the 10-page limit be enforced on the frontend or backend?
   - What format should the parsed/summarized data take in the database?
   - Are there specific performance requirements for the AI parsing (e.g., max processing time)?

4. **User Experience**
   - Should users be able to edit/delete uploaded records?
   - What level of granularity is needed for the risk assessment display?
   - How should the system handle partial or unclear medical records?

Would you like me to focus on any particular aspect of this analysis or help clarify any of these points further?
