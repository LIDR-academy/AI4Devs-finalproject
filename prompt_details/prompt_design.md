     - **Upload Interface**: A clear, step-by-step upload process supports PDF and image formats. Users are guided through each step, including file selection, confirmation, and final upload.
     - **Secure Uploads**: Security is visually reinforced through icons or messaging (e.g., “End-to-End Encryption Enabled”) to reassure users that their sensitive information is protected.
     - **Data Review and Parsing**: After upload, users see an analysis preview screen where the AI parses information and provides summaries, highlights important metrics, and explains medical terms.

   - **User Flow**:
     1. **File Selection**: User selects “Upload Records” from the dashboard, accesses the upload screen, and chooses a PDF or image file.
     2. **Upload Confirmation**: After selecting a file, the system shows a confirmation prompt before securely uploading.
     3. **Parsed Output Display**: The AI processes the document, displaying insights such as flagged conditions, risk levels, and recommended next steps.

#### **Interactivity with Health Coach**
   - **Objective**: The Health Coach functions as a conversational AI that responds to user questions and offers tailored health advice.
   
   - **Design Elements**:
     - **Chat Interface**: A conversational UI where users can ask freeform health questions or select from suggested prompts (e.g., “How can I reduce my blood pressure?”).
     - **Custom Responses**: The chatbot provides responses based on the user’s personal health data, explaining complex terms in layman’s terms.
     - **Secure and Private Communication**: The chat interface displays a security badge (e.g., “Private and Secure”) ensuring user confidence.

   - **User Flow**:
     1. **Question Submission**: User accesses the Health Coach interface from the dashboard, enters a question or selects a prompt.
     2. **AI Response**: The AI analyzes the question, references relevant user data, and provides a response.
     3. **Follow-Up Suggestions**: The coach may offer further recommendations or link back to other features (e.g., “Based on your cholesterol level, consider running a digital twin simulation”).

#### **Digital Twin Simulations**
   - **Objective**: This feature allows users to simulate lifestyle changes and visualize the potential impact on their health.
   
   - **Design Elements**:
