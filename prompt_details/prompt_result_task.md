- **Criteria of Acceptance**:  
  - Users can upload files through the UI.  
  - File type and size validations are implemented.  
  - Files are temporarily stored on the client side before preprocessing.

#### **Task 2: PII Masking and File-to-Text Conversion**  

- **Title**: PII Masking and File-to-Text Conversion  
- **Description**:  
  Implement a frontend feature to preprocess uploaded health records by:  
  1. Automatically detecting and masking personally identifiable information (PII) (e.g., names, dates of birth).  
  2. Converting files (PDF, DOCX) into plaintext format for secure backend storage.  
  Ensure the process happens entirely on the client side for privacy.  

- **Criteria of Acceptance**:  
  - PII is detected and masked in uploaded files.  
  - Files are converted to plaintext format on the frontend.
